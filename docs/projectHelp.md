1) install parcel
2) install other dependencies check his Package.json
3) eslint file can copy paste from your repo
4) everything else is doing React.createElement , render root, file, script tag with type module because Parcel needs that, source is index.js file, index.js file is all your code where you create all your elements.  You will never create a React app but it’s good practice to understand what’s under the hoop
